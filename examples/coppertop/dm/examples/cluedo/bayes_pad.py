# we generate all possibilities of hands and, as well as eliminating possible hands that include a suggestion if the
# player passed, we can also eliminate all possible hands that do not include a suggestion if the player revealed a card
# we can then calculate the probabilities of the location of every card in every hand
# this can be used as a prior for analysing each player's suggestions - e.g. likelihood of a suggestion with 0 cards in
# a players hand presumably is higher than the likelihood of a suggestion with 1 card in a players hand and so on

# combinations of cards in hands - in TBI there are 6 * 6 * 9 possible combinations
# [5, 4, 4] game
# 90090 combinations for the other players hands * 324 for the different TBI combinations


# [5, 4, 4] >> nPartitions = 90090              16 free cards -> 4 bits is fine
# [4, 4, 3, 3] >> nPartitions = 4,204,200       17 free cards -> 8 bits is required
# [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] >> nPartitions = 168,168,000  18 free cards -> 8 bits is required

# likelihood is a f64, cardId are u8
# (90090 * 8 + 90090 * 13) * 324 = 1,891,890 * 324 = 612,972,360
# (4204200 * 8 + 4204200 * 14) * 324 = 92,492,400 * 324 = 29,999,999,600
# (168168000 * 8 + 168168000 * 15) * 324 = 3,564,528,000 * 324 = 1,156,800,000,000

# for a 5, 4, 4 game our combinations array is 90090 * 324 columns and 16 rows
# cols 1, 2, 3 are TBI cards where P(personcard) = normalised sum of P where card is in col 1, P(weaponcard) in col 2, etc
# cols 4, 5, 6, 7 are player2 cards where P(card) = normalised sum of P where card is in col 4 or 5 or 6 or 7

# 6 player game => 817,296,480,000 and even with 4 bits per cardId it is 400GB! so only model once there is enough
# information known to reduce the number of possibilities to a manageable size


# unless we're going to dynamically shrink the size of the array the combinations array will last the duration of the
# entire game

# how much edge can we get from the combinations array?
# how much additional edge can we get from incorporating the suggestion likelihood function?

# if we are equal to the computer players we will win 1 in 4 4 player games, 1 in 5 5 player games, etc.
